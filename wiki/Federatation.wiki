#summary Nuclear's native federated relation and distribution system.

= Introduction =

Nuclear has a native protocol supporting both a federated model for social relation as well as entry or packet notification broadcast to subscribed parties. We should move this page from http://nuclearworks.pbworks.com/Federated-Packet-Specification


= Details =

The basis of the Federated Micro-Publishing specification relies on OAuth established relationships for distribution across domains. In the current specification, we rely on established, hard-specified endpoints and a semi-finite xml packet structure. There should be a few changes to these items.

  * Endpoints for all modes of operation should be established as a single url.
  * Endpoints should be a link element in a domain or subdomain page.
  * Endpoints will be stored per-domain.

  * Internal representation of entries will be an object.
  * External representation of entries will be xml.
  * A JSON representation may exist in the future, but XML will be bread and butter.

  * Storage of entries may be specified with Event listeners.
  * External fp terminology will be changed to entry.
