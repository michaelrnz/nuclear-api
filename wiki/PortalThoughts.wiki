=Introduction=

Our primary concern is with the parameters of an endpoint (portal has magic) and their purpose.

==Mode==
 
Mode designates what function the packet is designated. Notify is default?

==Party==
 
The sender, or owner of the content? Acct might work better? So we parse acct from the beginning, or check what the packet is going to do?
 
  * Parsing the acct, we can check the magic signatures and/or acquire the right domain info.
  * Checking the packet might allows us to avoid verifying the signature.
  * How do we determine packet "types"
    * ActivityStreams?
    * inclusive/exclusive/default
