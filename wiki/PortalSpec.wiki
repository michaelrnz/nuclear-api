#summary Minute details documenting Nuclear's native federated model. (very rough)

= Introduction =

Nuclear is a fully-federated relation framework. We document here the small details which allow federating non-Nuclear platforms. Much of the model will rely on OStatus, namely PuSH or Cloud for distribution of general entries, but we highly rely on the concept of magic keys (ssl) used by Salmon for more finite distribution of data.

= Data Format =

We wish to adhere to a similar packet format as Atom (entry, author, title, summary, content), with reliance on extended namespaces such as ActivityStreams. Data posted to a portal (endpoint) should contain a data parameter (REST). A brief structure follows.

entry
  * *id* - integer id of entry on local node
  * *guid* - uuid of entry on all nodes (originates at source)
  * *timestamp* - GMT timestamp in seconds
  * *created_at* - GMT date (Tue May 18 3:37:01 +0000 2010)
  * visibility - private or public
  * source - contains name/url of client
  * *author* - contains author data
  * *text* - a text representation of the entry
  * title
  * summary
  * actions (ActionStatus)
  * activity (ActivityStream)
  * attachment
    * type
    * url
    * disposition
  * thr (in_reply_to) - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4685.txt

Bold properties should always be expected

== The guid ==

The guid element should be a uuid similar to that generated by <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_uuid">MySQL</a> and similar databases. Preferably, the 128-bit number should be represented as generated (with hyphens), as hex, or in base62.

The Nuclear portal will not hard enforce this identifier, and therefore, positive integers in hex, decimal, or base62 encoding are accepted, but must not exceed 128-bit binary value.

The one requirement of the guid is that it is completely unique for the given author of an entry. We do this as a measure for profile portability, and referencing the author-guid pair on the author's local domain should ensure proper lookup even in the event the author migrates domains.
