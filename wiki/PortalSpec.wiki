#summary Minute details documenting Nuclear's native federated model. (very rough)

= Introduction =

Nuclear is a fully-federated relation framework. We document here the small details which allow federating non-Nuclear platforms. Much of the model will rely on OStatus, namely PuSH or Cloud for distribution of general entries, but we highly rely on the concept of magic keys (ssl) used by Salmon for more finite distribution of data.

= Data Format =

We wish to adhere to a similar packet format as Atom (entry, author, title, summary, content), with reliance on extended namespaces such as ActivityStreams. Data posted to a portal (endpoint) should contain a data parameter (REST). A brief structure follows.

entry
  *id* - integer id of entry on local node
  *guid* - uuid of entry on all nodes (originates at source)
  *timestamp* - GMT timestamp in seconds
  *created_at* - GMT date (Tue May 18 3:37:01 +0000 2010)
  visibility - private or public
  source - contains name/url of client
  *author* - contains author data
  *text* - a text representation of the entry
  title
  summary
  actions (ActionStatus)
  activity (ActivityStream)
  attachment
    type
    url
    disposition

Bold properties should always be expected.
